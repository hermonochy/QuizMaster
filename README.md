### Quiz Game

Press either `Play a Quiz` or `Make a Quiz` in the homepage. `Make a Quiz` will open QuizCreator, `Play a Quiz` will allow you to search a quiz to play! You can either press the number allocated to the answer or, if you don't have a keyboard, click on the answer. Remember, you have a time limit!

### Quiz Creator

1. Run quizcreator by opening QuizMaster and clicking "Make a quiz". You can also start it separately with `./quizcreator` on the command line interface in Linux.
2. Use it to manage and create quiz questions. The `Add` button can add questions. As it is multiple choice, you need to give a correct answser and wrong answers, seperated by commas. Afterwards, save it in an apropriate folder. A common mistake made by many users is to leave the question editor window open, which blocks QuizCreator.
